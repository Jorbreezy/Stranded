user inputs
1) Vehicle type
2) Energy Type
3) Energy Amount

using the vehicle type and a hardcoded object, we find the weight
using the energy type, we determine the units
using the energy type and energy amount, we find the
total energy produced

distance = Energy produced / vehicle weight
calculate distance from that formula

MAP
We used the google maps' API and it provided functionality for the highlighting of the radius. 
So using these tools we used the distance in miles to show the radius that you can travel from the energy that is produced which results in the amount of miles. Results were used folr the maps to display the radius.
